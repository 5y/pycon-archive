                                <h3>About Heroku</h3>
<p>Heroku is a thriving start-up owned by Salesforce.com, based in SOMA, San Francisco. Our work environment is fun and flexible while also ruthlessly focused on technical excellence and customer success. Our growing group offers lots of opportunities for hyper talented, self- motivated, no-drama and no-nonsense individuals who share our belief that cloud architectures are dramatically changing web application development and deployment, and want to be part of the vanguard of this movement.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://heroku.theresumator.com/apply/wwPdDw/Data-Infrastructure-Developer.html," title="http://heroku.theresumator.com/apply/wwPdDw/Data-Infrastructure-Developer.html">Data Infrastructure Developer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://heroku.theresumator.com/apply/cWZJ3U/Platform-Security-Engineer.html" title="http://heroku.theresumator.com/apply/cWZJ3U/Platform-Security-Engineer.html">Platform Security Engineer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We think that San Francisco is the best place in the world to be a software developer. If you are not currently a US resident, we can sponsor your H1B visa. That said, we'd love to hear from anyone who would be a good fit.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Heroku Data Infrastructure Developer</h3>
<p>We're looking for a talented developer who will join us in reinventing how databases are deployed, used, and protected.</p>
<p>The Department of Data is a small team that operates as an autonomous internal startup within Heroku, and provides performant data services in a highly dynamic (some would say chaotic) environment. We manage one of the largest collections of databases in the world, and you could have an impact on every part of that, whether it's designing simple, intuitive workflows for our users, contributing to projects like PostgreSQL, or building bulletproof administration and monitoring tools.</p>
<p><strong>You should be excited to learn any of these skills you lack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby command line tools</li>
<li>RESTful API design and implementation</li>
<li>Internal administration tool design</li>
<li>Queueing and messaging (e.g. rabbitmq, beanstalkd)</li>
<li>Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, and NoSQL databases)</li>
<li>Horizontal scaling</li>
<li>High availability systems</li>
<li>Ruby, Python, and bash</li>
<li>Unix tools</li>
<li>Amazon web services (EC2, SDB, S3, et al.)</li>
<li>Unix Filesystems and Networking</li>
<li>Designing secure systems</li>
<li>Ops or DevOps experience (this is a developer position, but it helps to know what it's like on the ops side of things)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A resume is good, but we'd like to get to know you. Here are some of the ways you can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A link to your Github account or other source code you've worked on</li>
<li>Two or three code snippets that you think represent your coding style</li>
<li>Brief description of your skills, passions, and work style</li>
<li>Link to your blog and/or other personal/hobby apps you’ve built</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heroku Platform Security Engineer</h3>
<p>Heroku’s security team is responsible for the overall security of the Heroku platform and our infrastructure, and for compliance with established security policies. We’re looking for dedicated security engineers, who understand platforms and their unique security challenges, to join the team.</p>
<p>If you’re the right person for this job, you take a systematic approach to security. You deeply understand and automatically apply concepts such as defense in depth and the principle of least privilege, and know how to assess cost and risk to prioritize your work. You set a high standard in your own work, and also enjoy helping others with their security challenges.</p>
<h4>Key responsibilities</h4>

                                <h1>Counsyl</h1>
<p><strong>Position:</strong> Software Engineer</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> South San Francisco </p>
<p><strong>CAType:</strong> Full Time</p>
<h4>About Counsyl Engineering</h4>
<p>Over the last few years, we've grown from a dorm room start to become one of the largest clinical genome centers in the world. Our pre-pregnancy genomic test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 2.5% of all births in the United States.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, handling this kind of volume puts us in terra incognita. Our situation is similar to the one faced by Amazon in the 90s, before anyone knew how to scale an operation with such highly interconnected physical and informational components.</p>
<p>To solve the problems associated with scaling the medical genome, we hire generalists rather than specialists. Our engineers are pragmatists who know when to use machine learning and when to use a simple regex, and understand in what sense those approaches are at different ends of a continuum. Many did not have a bioinformatics background before they joined, but all had strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>Experience in general means little to us as genomics is a young field; working code means quite a lot more. If this sounds like your kind of company, we invite you to apply.</p>
<h4>About you</h4>
<p>You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science (or equivalent) and/or significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by Github account, personal web page, or prior employment. </p>
<p>You should also be a generalist, interested in rotating through the engineering team and working in one or more of these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genomics: design, validate, and optimize clinical genomic assays for rare Mendelian variants </li>
<li>Machine Learning and Data Science: extract meaning out of one of the largest clinical genomic datasets in the world</li>
<li>Robotics: automate and scale our backend to do more clinical sequencing and genotyping than anyone has ever done before</li>
<li>UI/UX: design the first widely adopted user interface for the medical genome</li>
<li>Clinical Integration: solve the wide variety of practical issues associated with translating genomics into a clinical context</li>
<li>Infrastructure: build and deploy the hardware and software systems that support secure, large-scale computations on genomic datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>From a skills perspective, you should have familiarity with several of the following technologies. We obviously don’t expect you to know everything on the list, but you should be nodding to yourself by the end of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python: Django, Numpy, Scipy, Cython</li>
<li>HTML/CSS/JS: Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Twitter Bootstrap 2, HTML5 APIs, Chrome Web Inspector</li>
<li>C++: STL, gcc/g++, Boost, C++11</li>
<li>Functional Programming: Haskell, underscore.js, functional reactive programming </li>
<li>Data Science and Visualization: GNU GSL, CUDA, Netlib/LAPACK, graphviz, R, Matlab, Matplotlib, Numerical Recipes</li>
<li>DevOps/System Administration: Amazon Web Services, Puppet, nginx, nagios, Apache, Fabric</li>
<li>APIs: REST, JSON, SOA, and all that jazz</li>
<li>Biological Databases: NCBI, UCSC, 1000 Genomes, Hapmap, UK10K</li>
<li>Sequencing/Computational Biology: OLB, samtools/pysam, pygr, galaxy/bxpython, kent utilities</li>
<li>Unix/Linux: bash/zsh, emacs/vim, git, GNU toolchain</li>
<li>PostgreSQL: psycopg2, hstore, replication</li>
<li>Security: skipfish, SSL, fuzz testing, preventing XSS &amp; SQL injections</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, please consider these guidelines, not absolutes. For example, if you know Chef, we figure you can learn Puppet, and if you know Ruby, we figure you can learn Python. </p>
<p>In general, you should enjoy taking care of the practical last mile problems needed to actually achieve a societal ROI on the world's multibillion dollar investment in the Human Genome Project.</p>
<h4>What you'll do</h4>
<ul>
<li>Move fast without breaking things :)</li>
<li>Start in the areas you're familiar with, and grow to work on the full stack</li>
<li>Work closely with a small, tight-knit team</li>
<li>Develop algorithms and code for all aspects of clinical genomics, from machine learning to supply chain optimization to insurance billing</li>
<li>Quite literally save lives with your keyboard</li>
</ul>
<h4>What you'll get</h4>
<ul>
<li>Competitive compensation and start-up equity package</li>
<li>Excellent health insurance</li>
<li>Catered meals every day plus a fully stocked fridge</li>
<li>Gym access to work it off</li>
<li>MacBook Pro, 30" monitor, iPad, iPhone, and all the gadgets you need</li>
</ul>

We love your iteration of data structures of depth and breadth;</p>
<p>The way you let our small team ship
Or powering our backend, oh so quick.</p>
<p>Delivering millions of chat messages to our customers per week,
Enabling website visitors and owners to speak.</p>
<p>Pulling up debug information for customers and further,
Monitoring server performance - what could be worthier?</p>
<p>You are beyond just a fancy technical-problem-solving hammer
A tool for us to make websites more human, a communications spanner</p>
<p>We shall but love thee better when we have more Python developers.</p>

                                <h1>Thumbtack</h1>
<p>We're an early-stage, venture-capital funded startup that's experiencing rapid growth and looking to expand our engineering team. We’re essentially Amazon for local services.</p>
<p>Thumbtack provides a marketplace and review site for local services such as handymen, tutors, gardeners, etc. Thumbtack gives users the ability to vet, contact, and book providers.</p>
<p>It's a robust platform and has a ton of traction already. We have 275,000 professionals signed up, 800,000 monthly uniques, and are growing rapidly. We just received $4.5 million in Series A funding in January bringing our total up to $6 million. We're at 12 people total (4 engineers) and come from a variety of interesting places (ex-Googlers, ex-White House employee, a few Stanford, Yale and Harvard alumni, etc).</p>
<h4>Why Thumbtack?</h4>
<ul>
<li>There’s a bounty of extremely difficult challenges we’re looking to tackle. Engineers are given freedom and autonomy over their projects and can pursue a 
variety of different avenues.</li>
<li>Help hundreds of thousands of mom &amp; pop, independent professionals find work.</li>
<li>We receive emails weekly from our users, thanking us for bringing them work that helps pay their bills and put gas in their cars.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Some interesting problems we’ve tackled at Thumbtack</h4>
<ul>
<li>Powerful event tracking, reporting, and experiment framework - We track and test everything, and needed a tool to log, aggregate, and analyze all that data. We built a tracking powerhouse whose crowning feature is an experimentation framework with beautiful statistics and visualizations that instantly tell us how code changes are affecting metrics across the board.</li>
<li>Dynamic web crawling - We built a fast, distributed crawler with custom data processing. It quickly scales up or down depending on our needs and the cost of machine time.</li>
<li>Elegant peer-to-peer payments - We’re making a true marketplace where buyers and sellers transact through our trusted payments. Building a fresh, engaging user experience is as important as protecting data security and integrity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>We have no specific requirements, other than this: you must be a great problem solver who understands modern web technology and has a passion for great code. </p>
<p>We’re growing rapidly, so we’re looking to bring a variety of people on board who can help us keep up and expand into a bunch of different areas!</p>

<h2>About you (role #1):</h2>

<li>On a few occasions you've decided on a hashtable instead of an AVL tree and vice versa.</li>
<li>You have strong opinions about MongoDB, PostgreSQL, threads and build systems. </li>
<li>You love UNIX and hate meetings as much as we do.</li>
<li>You often wish you were smarter, coding in Haskell or LISP full-time.</li>
<li>You want to learn from us and you have something to teach.</li>
<li>You're fine with duck typing but also mastered at least one lower level language: C, C++ or similar.</li>
<li>You've managed your own memory on multiple occasions (successfully).</li>
</ul>
<h2>About you (role #2):</h2>
<ul>
<li>You are an intellectually curious US-based hacker.</li>
<li>You can tell a beautiful API design when you see it.</li>
<li>You believe you could design a better REST API than some products you've used.</li>

<li>There is something about programming languages. You've played with most and learned a few.</li>
<li>You want to learn from us and you have something to teach.</li>
<li>You enjoy writing and want to get better at it.</li>
<li>You've spoken publicly, it was scary at first. You loved the experience.</li>
<li>When you go to technology conferences you have a good time.</li>
<li>You're ashamed because you're spending too much time on Hacker News and Stack Overflow and Quora.</li>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Software Engineer</p>
<p><strong>Locations:</strong> Ames, IA | Bozeman, MT | Denver, CO | Scottsdale, AZ</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Full-time | Internship</p>
<p>WebFilings’ software engineers develop best-in-class, next-generation collaborative applications for accounting and finance teams around the world.  We hire smart people with a broad set of skills who are ready to tackle some of technology’s greatest challenges.  We work on problems ranging from real time collaborative editing to distributed map-reduce algorithms to data warehousing on the latest cloud technologies.</p>
<p>WebFilings’ culture is highly innovative and team-oriented.  We encourage autonomy and provide you the opportunity to develop mastery in areas about which you are passionate.  As a software engineer at WebFilings, you will clearly understand the needs of our customers and the benefits our software provides them and their community.  Since we develop and release on extremely fast cycles, you will see your code live, in production, often within days or weeks rather than the months or years as with some companies.  We work with the best tools we can find and are always improving ourselves and our process.  Candidates should be interested in challenging and improving themselves as a developer and helping your team members to do the same.</p>
<h3>We Have Three Unique Developer Profiles:</h3>
<h4>Cloud Computing Infrastructure and Services Developer</h4>
<p>We develop on the latest cloud computing technologies including Google AppEngine and Amazon EC2 in a hybrid cloud environment unlike anything else in the industry.  We focus on scalability and performance, building a platform that will scale to support tens of thousands of users.</p>
<h4>Web Developer</h4>
<p>We develop highly interactive web applications using the latest web and browser technologies including HTML5, AJAX, Javascript, CSS, and related libraries.  These applications stretch the boundaries of what is possible for a browser-based application and deliver a user experience that is second to none.</p>
<h4>Rich Internet Application Developer</h4>
<p>RIA developers will be working on a cutting-edge platform that combines a state of the art Google App Engine back-end with a large scale Flash Player-based enterprise application written with the Flex SDK in Actionscript.  Attention to detail, crafting superior user experiences, and writing high-performance efficient code are all key qualities necessary for this position. This is not your typical form-based database front-end, this is a highly interactive, collaborative, rich content creation environment.</p>
<h4>Windows .NET Developer</h4>
<p>We develop .NET components in C# that are used in a variety of environments.  Our most pressing need is for developers who have written Microsoft Office add-ins or integrations with Microsoft Office tools.  We also write ASP.NET code that gets deployed in the cloud and helps us to deliver some of the best collaborative experiences possible.</p>
<h4>What you’ll be doing</h4>
<p>You’ll be working directly with a team of world-class product managers, developers, and UX professionals to build products that are simple and intuitive. Your responsibilities will include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Writing unit tests for everything you build</li>
<li>Refining your design until it is right and users love it</li>
<li>Mastering Agile software development methodology</li>
<li>Drinking free soda and Starbuck’s coffee along with all of the healthy snacks you can eat</li>
</ul>
<h4>What we are looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>Intense passion for programming</li>
<li>Communication skills to clearly articulate problems and solutions</li>
<li>Self-motivation and excellent problem-solving skills</li>

<p>Esri is headquartered in Redlands, ideally located in Southern California and central to beaches, mountains, and deserts. We create software that makes a difference in society—Esri inspires and enables governments, universities, and businesses worldwide to save money, lives, and our environment through a deeper understanding of the changing world around them. Python is fully integrated into Esri’s ArcGIS, a complete system that enables organizations to collect, manage, and analyze geographic information for better decision making.</p>
<p>Our development teams have regular contact with our customers, whether it’s at our Developer Summit in Palm Springs (the dodge ball tournament is a must-see), International User Conference in San Diego (a gathering of 14,000 geogeeks), or the Dev Meet Ups we sponsor (happy hour just for developers). We take as many opportunities as we can to learn what our customers like about our software and, more importantly, what they’d like to see changed so we can continue to create the best geospatial technology available.</p>
<p>These are just two current openings where you can put your Python expertise to work at Esri:</p>

Qualifications include one year of Python programming experience, a minimum of six months of specific training with an ArcGIS product, and experience and understanding of applying GIS to solving real world problems.</p>
<p>Software Development Internship—No GIS required! Depending on your areas of study and interest, you'll work on our desktop, web, mobile, 2D/3D visualization, imagery, or core server team.

<p>Since you'll be joining a small technical team, you'll take the lead on core projects from the get-go and often work independently. We're nimble and push code almost every day, but because our product reaches tens of millions of users, everything must be bulletproof.</p>
<p>Skills and Qualifications
<strong>Ability to embrace the energy and drive of a close-knit start-up team.
</strong>Self-starter with the creativity and initiative to brainstorm, propose, and dive into implementing solutions.
<strong>Strong command of Python and up-to-date knowledge of its ecosystem. We love Python and use it throughout our back-end.
</strong>Proficiency with JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3 and keen awareness of the state-of-the-art in browser technology. Our HTML-based document viewer is the face of Crocodoc, and we keep it polished.
<strong>Comfort working in (and improving) a Linux-based development and deployment environment.
</strong>Familiarity with distributed computing. We use Celery to coordinate dozens of servers to process documents within a matter of seconds.
**Understanding of cloud-based infrastructure and all the benefits and drawbacks it provides. We're on Amazon AWS and dig its flexibility.</p>
<p>At Crocodoc, you'll be working with a savvy tech team that enjoys solving tough problems and loves to learn and leverage new technologies when it makes sense. If that sounds like your cup of tea, we'd love to hear from you. (Email us at jobs@crocodoc.com.)</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Software Developer
<strong>Location:</strong> Santa Monica, CA</p>
<p>Think Good Will Hunting meets The A-Team to grasp the kind of Developer who clicks at Hulu: one moment staring at a whiteboard trying to prove the Riemann Hypothesis and then 15 minutes later working with other Developers on the architecture for a cheap file storage solution to be used for transcoding petabytes of data. We are looking for Developers who have a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals, experience across multiple technologies and applications, and the ability to learn quickly.</p>

<li>Broad cross-disciplinary development experience, including strong experience with test-driven development</li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of web-service/data-driven application architecture</li>
<li>A good sense of what goes into making a successful consumer product</li>
<li>The ability to jump into a project and contribute immediately to both architecture and implementation</li>
<li>Great communication and collaboration skills and a strong teamwork ethic</li>
</ul>
<h4>Experience with the following technologies and applications is preferred but not required:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Objective-C, Java</li>

<li>Securing content on mobile devices</li>
<li>Flash</li>
<li>Content encoding</li>
<li>Multi-tier web applications</li>
</ul>
<h4>Since we're clearly into lists, here's a Top 5 for how you know you need to work at Hulu in no particular order:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You fall asleep thinking of ways to search through 100 billion sheep</li>
<li>You recently had a nightmare that involved an unbalanced red-black binary tree</li>
<li>You can compress better than H.264</li>
<li>You actively contribute to GitHub</li>
<li>You rule at ping-pong, eating contests or Project Euler</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're the kind of developer who obsesses over indentation (spaces or tabs), monitoring services, and jumps at the opportunity to take on new math challenges then Hulu may be the place for you.</p>
<p>Hulu is an equal opportunity employer.</p>

                                <p>At AppNeta we're looking for experienced engineers interested in building the next generation of developer performance tools.</p>
<p>We make TraceView (formerly Tracelytics), a web performance analytics product that traces Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, Apache, Nginx, etc.  We're a small team (currently 8 engineers) backed by a strong, growing company (AppNeta) that is investing heavily in our product's future.</p>
<p>We sit atop mountains of data and strive to provide intelligent, actionable insights for our customers about the performance of their app's code &amp; servers.  Processing &amp; visualizing it all (at scale) is a big challenge, and we’re looking for talented engineers to help us.</p>
<p>Our current stack is a growing "big data" system: we have a data faucet and processing pipeline that does a ton of writes (Python, Cassandra, Hadoop, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Celery, C/C++), a web backend that does a ton of reads (Python), and an elegant, powerful interface (Backbone, D3, jQuery).  We use it to analyze and visualize the performance of web applications.</p>
<p>Our work is distributed, agile, and test-driven. We're based in Boston, MA, with an office in Providence, RI.  If you're interested in talking further, feel free to reply directly to jobs@tracelytics.com or for more information, visit http://dev.appneta.com.</p>
<p>We're also looking for a talented frontend engineer who is comfortable working with Backbone &amp; D3.  Here's an automatic Backbone data dependency-tracking library that we recently released: http://tbonejs.org.</p>
