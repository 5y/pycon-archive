                                        <p><p>TrueCar is an information and technology platform that enables its users to communicate with TrueCar Certified Dealers for a hassle-free car-buying experience.</p>

<p>Our mission is simple: make the car-buying process simple, fair and fun. Achieving this goal begins with us analyzing the most accurate, timely and comprehensive pricing information available and then making it easy to understand and available to all; free of charge. This kind of pricing information, which has only recently become available, will allow you to recognize a fair price based on what others actually paid. The result: consumers and dealers now have a guide that helps them establish a baseline of trust and agree on the parameters of a fair deal.</p>

<p>While pricing information is essential, we also understand that price isn’t the only thing that matters when buying a car. You also want a great experience. So, we partnered with a national network of over 5,000 dealers (representing just under 20% of all franchised dealers) who share the belief that truth, transparency and fairness are the foundation of a great car-buying experience. Additionally, we’ve partnered with some of the nation’s largest and most respected membership and service organizations including AAA, American Express, Consumer Reports and USAA, to help educate their members about the automotive market and any additional savings and incentives that may be available.</p>

<p>At TrueCar we’re dedicated to removing the complexity from the car-buying process and making it fair. It’s a mission we’ve been on since 2005 and the results have been rewarding: over 600,000 vehicles have been delivered to TrueCar users by our Certified Dealer partners and TrueCar users have collectively saved over $1.5 billion off of MSRP since inception.<br /></p></p>

At the heart of Twitter are small bursts of information called Tweets, which are 140 characters or less in length. However, you don&#39;t have to tweet to use Twitter. Lots of people just use Twitter to get the latest information about the things that mean most to them. With 400 million Tweets per day and more than 200 million active users, there is something for everyone on Twitter, no matter what you&#39;re interested in or where you are in the world. Twitter can be accessed on the web, on smartphones and on the simplest of feature phones.</p>

<p>At Twitter, we believe that the open exchange of information can have a positive global impact and are inspired by stories of people using Twitter to improve the world in unexpected ways.</p>

Sysadmins now have the flexibility to write Python code, among other languages, to help manage the system via Remote Administration Daemon (RAD) Python language binding. As Solaris continues to evolve in the modern computing era, Python will play an even more important role in Solaris&#39; day-to-day operational standards.</p>

                                        <p><p>We here at AllTreatment are passionately pursuing ways to make treatment and recovery more accessible to anyone struggling with addiction. Most recently we worked together in a business that helped businesses and consumers find each other more effectively - by enabling businesses to more strategically position themselves on the internet.</p>

<p>In early 2009 we made a discovery. Each one of us has been personally affected by drug and alcohol abuse - with family members, relatives, and friends who are struggling with the disease of addiction. We began searching the internet for information on addiction and addiction recovery. What we found was many times indiscernible as it was either a government database that was difficult to navigate or it was a sales come-on disguised as information.</p>

<p>So AllTreatment was born. We are not affiliated with any specific treatment center or addiction recovery company. We are fully committed to helping individuals and families find useful, relevant, and trusted information on addiction and addiction recovery. We believe in creating awareness about addiction, encouraging and facilitating action toward recovery, and inspiring healing and growth personally and socially.</p></p>

The Cloudant Data Layer is a managed service that helps developers to eliminate the delays, costs, and distractions inherent in working with databases and their administrators, while providing unmatched scalability, availability, and performance. This capability accelerates time-to-market and time-to-innovation, because it frees developers from the mechanics of data management so they can focus exclusively on creating great applications. Cloudant is privately held and backed by top-tier investors including Avalon Ventures, In-Q-Tel, and Y Combinator.</p></p>

Collectively, we have experience and humility gained by making (and surviving) every stupid decision that could be imagined. We aim to bring fresh ideas to classic web development problems.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on a single web framework, the Pylons Project will develop a collection of related technologies. The first package from the Pylons Project was the Pyramid web framework. Other packages have been added to the collection over time, including higher-level components and applications. We hope to evolve the project into an ecosystem of well-tested, well-documented components which interoperate easily.</p></p>

                                        <p><p>IPython is an open source project that provides tools for interactive and parallel computing. It is best known for its enhanced Python shell whose features streamline interactive work: tab completion, integrated help, GUI toolkit support, system shell access, numbered prompts, command history and others. A powerful new architecture for remote code execution has opened the door for a number of new IPython components. A Qt based console provides an IPython shell with inline figures, graphical calltips and persistent sessions. A high-performance, low-latency parallel computing framework provides abstractions for parallelizing Python code on multicore CPUs, clusters, supercomputers and the cloud. The web-based IPython notebook provides<br />a user interface and open document format that mixes code with rich text, figures, mathematical equations and arbitrary HTML. </p>

<p>Today, IPython is included in all Linux distributions, EPD, Anaconda and Python(x,y). It is part of Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Tools for Python and the PyCharm IDE, and is a component of a multitude of scientific computing projects in many disciplines, from mathematical environments to hardware control in large experimental facilities.</p></p>

We recognize the problems many people--often women--have in presenting themselves to those running and hiring for tech teams, and we teach the kind of presentation and hireability that anyone needs to start their career in information technology.</p>

<p>Founded in Seattle by three female senior developers and software architects, LadyCoders is the first and only educational initiative to bridge the gap between learning to code and the many personal, social, networking, presentational, research, and preparatory skills needed to get job offers in the tech industry; we partner with community organizations, educational institutions, and companies who want to see more women succeed at IT careers. </p>

<p>Our events and seminars are open to, inclusive of, and useful to all gender identities and all people. Our speakers and teachers are skilled and accomplished professionals of all flavors who train from the legal, recruiting, technical interviewing, personal, and leadership perspectives.

                                        <p><p>Physics, medicine, astronomy—these and other hard sciences share a common need for efficient algorithms, system software, and computer architecture to address large computational problems. And yet, useful advances in computational techniques that could benefit many researchers are rarely shared. To meet that need, Computing in Science &amp; Engineering (CiSE) presents scientific and computational contributions in a clear and accessible format. CiSE is copublished by the IEEE Computer Society and the American Institute of Physics in technical cosponsorship with the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society and the IEEE Signal Processing Society.</p></p>
