        <div class="teaser"><p>We are proud to announce the accepted tutorials for PyCon 2011!</p>
<p>Choosing the tutorials this year was especially difficult, as we needed  to cut the number of proposals by half to fit into our limited space.  The quality of the proposals (and the proposed presenters) was  outstanding, and there was a lot of heartburn that resulted from the  difficult decisions we had to make to come to our list of tutorials for  PyCon 2011.</p>
<p>This year, however, we were helped by looking at the results of a poll we put out in mid December asking about the various topics we had available. While we would never claim that the poll was scientifically valid or completely representative of the community, we did find the results, coupled with experience with previous years very helpful in deciding which topics we would feature in the PyCon 2011 tutorials.</p>

<p>Congratulations to these tutorial presenters!</p>
<p>Based on the feedback we described, we grouped these into a number of themes, as shown below.</p>
</div>
        
        <div class="content"><p><b>Learning Python:</b> Some of the perennial favorite tutorials at PyCon are  our beginning and intermediate Python classes -- but that is not  surprising considering that almost half of the attendees at PyCon are  new to the language and relatively new to Python. This year, however, we  are making an effort to cater to a number of different audiences and  learning styles.</p>
<p>For those wanting an introduction to Python, we have three different teachers with three different styles. We are excited to annouce that we will be offering Python 101 by Stuart Williams, Beginning Python by Matt Harrison, and  Python For Total Beginners Using "Learn Python The Hard Way" by Zed Shaw.</p>
<p>First, we are pleased to announce the return of "Python 101" by Stuart Williams. Stuart is a software developer in the financial services industry and previously taught an Introduction to Computer Science instructor at the Canadian Mennonite University in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He has taught Python 101 at PyCon for a number of years to great reviews.</p>
<p>Second, we have Matt Harrison's "Hands on Beginning Python" and "Hands on Intermediate Python." Matt's tutorial last year on the "Meaty parts of Python" was one of the surprise hits of the tutorial schedule. For this year Matt has integrated test-driven development with his exercise-based classes to bring beginning programmers up to speed in Python. For those with more  experience, Matt's "Hands on Intermediate Python" will reprise many of  the meaty topics from last year's tutorial.</p>
<p>We are also excited to have Zed Shaw presenting "Python For Total  Beginners Using 'Learn Python The Hard Way.'" While many people know Zed  as a prolific writer, coder and Internet personality, not as many people  know that he has been called one of the finest technical presenters  currently active. Zed's "Learn Python the Hard Way" has received rave  reviews, and it will be a treat to have him present it in person.</p>
<p> <b>Advanced Python Classes:</b> We have traditionally not had as many  tutorials focusing on advanced Python functionality, so it was a  surprise to us when our poll indicated that the number one requested  subject for PyCon tutorials -- by far -- was advanced tips and tricks  for using Python. With such an outpouring of interest, we did not want  to disappoint. We have four tutorials that fit the bill: Advanced Python  I and Advanced Python II by Raymond Hettinger, Faster Python Programs  through Optimization by Mike Müller, and Doing Data Structures in Python  by Howard Whitson.</p>
<p>Raymond Hettinger is a core Python developer and consultant. His talk  from PyCon 2010, "Mastering Team Play," was rated as one of the best  talks of PyCon for its clear exposition of how to use the tools in the  Python standard library to solve interesting and difficult problems in a  clear and Pythonic manner.</p>
<p>Our other presenters are similarly distinguished. Mike Müller is a  regular on the PyCon tutorial lineup, with his "Faster Python Programs  through Optimization" a regular sellout for its practical and  example-intensive approach. Howard Whitston is an instructor at the  University of South Alabama with 27 years of teaching experience. His  tutorial on data structures in Python focuses on choosing the right tool  -- stacks, queues, binary search trees, and priority queues -- to handle  data problems both big and small.</p>
<p><b>High level, low level:</b> Our second-most-popular topic from the poll was  using Python together with C. Python and C are both powerful languages,  but their focus on high versus low-level programming makes them suitable  for different parts of the stack. We picked a couple of excellent  tutorials to guide attendees through the wilds of memory management: A  (Re-)Introduction to C for Pythonistas by Noah Kantrowitz, and Writing  Python extensions in C by Noufal Ibrahim.</p>
<p>Noah Kantrowitz is a full-time developer at Atari, with a number of  projects (including the well-known project management tool Trac) under  his belt. His (Re-)Introduction to C is designed to help programmers  familiar with Python and other high-level dynamic languages to get down  to the bits and bytes by focusing on writing clear, concise, and  idiomatic C code.</p>
<p>Once attendees have finished with Noah's (Re-)Introduction to C, they  can move on to Noufal Ibrahim's introduction to the C-Python API. Noufal  is a professional trainer in Bangalore, India and works regularly with  developers who need to wrap an existing API for use with Python.</p>
<p>In a similar vein is Justin Heath's "Packet Crafting with Python." For  years Justin was a principal engineer on Snort, the well-known network  intrusion system. Justin's tutorial will dive in to the very lowest  levels of networking with Python, showing how to use tools like scapy,  dpkt and impacket to read, build, manipulate, and replay network data.</p>
<p><b>Web Frameworks:</b> It should not be surprising that the next biggest area  of interest came from addressing the web and the various ways Python can  make it easier to create web applications. Django and Web2Py both ranked  highly in terms of developer interest, with other aspects of web  development also receiving a number of votes. For those working on the  web, we are happy to present a variety of classes that will make your  web work faster and more efficient.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pinax Solutions, by Daniel Greenfeld and Brian Rosner: Danny and Brian  are Pinax core developers both using Pinax to develop and deploy  websites every day. "Pinax Solutions" will take attendees from Pinax  installation up through deployment, with instructive stops dealing with  authentication, extending Pinax, media handling, and working with the  Pinax and Django communities.</li>
<li>Web2py Secrets by Massimo Di Pierro: Massimo is the BDFL of the Web2Py  community and a professor at DePaul University in Chicago. Web2Py has  been embraced by a number of developers for its core focus on getting  things done. Massimo will show how Web2Py's internal design and modular  architecture can be used to build rich, AJAX-ready interfaces.</li>
<li>Python/Django deployment workshop by Jacob Kaplan-Moss: We are glad to  include in PyCon 2011 a return of Jacob's highly rated Django deployment  workshop. Attendees last year raved about Jacob's meticulous preparation  and engaging style - and this year promises to be even better. Jacob is  possibly the most qualified person on earth to talk about mastering  Django deployment issues; come and learn from the Django BDFL himself.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Cloud computing:</b> One of Python's strengths is that it is a popular  choice for cloud computing. From Amazon AWS to Google App Engine, we are  grateful to have a variety of experts teaching how to effectively  leverage the cloud services available to build applications that scale.</p>
<p>We start with "Distributed and Cloud computing with Python" by Aaron  Staley. As a cofounder of PiCloud, Aaron has extensive experience  dealing with many different cloud computing solutions. Aaron will  present an overview of running Python in the cloud with examples showing  the use of Pyro, Oracle's Grid Engine, Google App Engine, MapReduce  using Hadoop, and PiCloud's distributed function facility.</p>
<p>Moving from the general to the specific, the most prominent cloud  computing provider today is Amazon. ThoughtWorks consultant Cosmin  Stejerean will present "Deploying web applications to the cloud,"  focusing on the step-by-step process of moving a Django application to  Amazon AWS and configuring it to take advantage of Amazon's load  balancing, auto scaling, content delivery, and relational database  services. Participants can use Amazon's recently released "free"  development tier to gain hands-on experience deploying to the cloud.</p>
<p>For those focusing more on Google App Engine, we are excited to have  Googler Wesley Chun presenting the "Google App Engine workshop." Wesley  is an experienced speaker, writer, and consultant, and shows how to  leverage the newest tools provided by AppEngine to create applications  that run distributed over Google's massive data-crunching facilities.</p>
<p><b>GUI Development:</b> Of course, we know that not all development is web  development. We are glad to have professional engineer Paul Kippes  teaching a two-part course on GUI development with PyQt. By the end of  the course attendees will have an understanding of the Qt library and  tools and be able to create simple but useful GUIs in Python.</p>
<p><b>Python 3:</b> Another up-and-coming topic in the Python community is the  movement to Python 3. Python 3 cleans up some of the "warts" of Python  and makes it cleaner, lighter, and more consistent -- at the price of  backwards compatibility with Python 2.</p>
<p>PyCon 2011 will feature a pair of tutorials focusing on Python 3, both  with David Beazley as a presenter. David Beazley is best known as the  author of the Python Essential Reference and the creator of SWIG. When  he's not breaking the GIL, he spends his time teaching a variety of  diabolical Python training courses.</p>
<p>The first Python 3 tutorial is a repeat of last year's "Mastering Python  3 I/O," our number-one-rated tutorial. "Mastering Python 3 I/O" takes a  top-to-bottom tour of the entire Python 3 I/O system and provides  practical advice for programmers porting code from Python 2 to Python 3.</p>
<p>"Cooking with Python 3" brings in Brian Jones, co-editor of the new  all-Python-3 edition of the Python Cookbook, for a fun and interactive  tour through what's new in Python 3. David and Brian will take on all a  variety of challenges through a lively mix of interactive demos,  examples, and discussion.</p>
<p><b>Data and Science with Python:</b> Another consistent theme from the  responses to our poll was that people want to learn more about data and  science applications with Python. Our tutorial selections for PyCon 2011  were also designed to help scientists, engineers, and geographic  information specialists.</p>
<p>Our first tutorial in this group is Mike Müller's "Scientific Python  Tools not only for Scientists and Engineers." In this tutorial, Mike  addresses the wealth of tools that Python offers for the interactive  exploration of data, including NumPy, matplotlib, IPython, Cython, and  others.</p>
<p>Moving to some more specific topics, we are delighted that Matthew  Russell, author of O'Reilly's "Mining the Social Web" will be presenting  "Mining and Visualizing Data from the Social Web with Python." Matthew  regularly presents as part of his effort to get people busy hacking on  social data. As he puts it, "The possibilities are immense, and I'd like  to raise awareness and show people how low the bar to entry really is."</p>
<p>Continuing in the same sphere is Olivier Grisel's "Applied Machine  Learning in Python with scikit-learn." Olivier is an R&amp;D engineer at  Nuxeo working on text analytics and natural language processing, where  he uses scikit-learn to build machine learning applications for a number  of different areas. Scikit-learn integrates machine learning into NumPy,  SciPy, and matplotlib making it easy to integrate classical machine  learning into any data-wranglers toolset.</p>
<p>For those working more on geographic information systems, PyCon will  include Andrii Mishkovskyi's "Building your own tile server using  OpenStreetMap." OpenStreetMap is a Creative Commons-licensed set of map  tiles that are continually being improved by an international group of  volunteers. Andrii's professional work as a GIS developer will help him  walk attendees through the process of building their own  Google-maps-like tile server that they can use to explore geographic  points of interest.</p>
<p>For those wanting something more advanced, Roy Hyunjin Han's "  Geospatial Computation and Visualization Cooperative Lab" is designed to  move beginning GIS developers up into the ranks of the experienced by  working in small groups on an extensive set of guided exercises with  provided solutions.</p>
<p><b>The Meaty Parts of PyCon:</b> Last, but certainly not least, are some of  the most useful tutorials included in PyCon. Sometimes the hardest  challenges are come in mastering the mechanics of an important task. For  these tasks, we have a series of tutorials that will help attendees with  the practical tasks associated with building and maintaining an active  codebase.</p>
<p>Our first of these tutorials is Christopher Perkins' "Packaging,  Documenting, and Distributing your Python Codebase." Christopher is a  long-time developer and contributor to Turbogears, Sprox, and c5t, among  others. He has the experience to help attendees make their personal and  professional projects fit for release.</p>
<p>The second tutorial is Brandon Craig Rhodes' "Documenting Your Project  with Sphinx." "Documenting Your Project with Sphinx" is a requested  repeat from last year's tutorial selections, and Brandon's engaging  style makes any topic - including writing documentation! - enjoyable and  engaging.</p>
<p>Whew! It is an amazing lineup of tutorials - and PyCon 2011 will be an  amazing conference. Remember, we will be capping registration for PyCon  2011 at 1500 delegates, so register today to reserve your spot.</p>
<p>Also, for those who have already registered, you will be able to go back in to add or specify tutorials. The ability to do so will be up shortly.</p>
