At Thumbtack we're reimagining the way local services are bought and sold, helping millions of consumers and professionals across America.

Currently, we connect millions of customers and service professionals to help customers turn personal projects into accomplishments and to help service professionals build their businesses. With a recent funding round from Sequoia, we are looking to grow our engineering team exponentially.

Our nine-person engineering team is effectively building two products
- one for consumers looking for services and the other for professionals seeking new jobs. There really aren't any good analogous products out there, so we're genuinely forging a new user experience, which means a lot of creative thinking and risk-taking. This means discovering, researching and implementing anything that moves us towards our vision, which often takes the form of new product features, but also includes improvements to Thumbtack backend matching system, internal tools to give us insight into Thumbtack ecosystem, engineering infrastructure to keep the team humming along, and anything else that feels like an exciting opportunity. Beyond, these technical challenges, it's very rewarding to work on a real-world problem that affects real people and their livelihoods. 

The opportunity we're pursuing is extraordinary, and we want you to be a part of it. We're looking for exceptionally intelligent, driven and resourceful engineers to join our team.
