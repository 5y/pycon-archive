At the heart of Twitter are small bursts of information called Tweets, which are 140 characters or less in length. However, you don&#39;t have to tweet to use Twitter. Lots of people just use Twitter to get the latest information about the things that mean most to them. With 500 million Tweets per day and more than 230 million active users, there is something for everyone on Twitter, no matter what you&#39;re interested in or where you are in the world. Twitter can be accessed on the web, on smartphones and on the simplest of feature phones.</p>

<p>At Twitter, we believe that the open exchange of information can have a positive global impact and are inspired by stories of people using Twitter to improve the world in unexpected ways.</p>

CloudSigma was founded to meet the growing need for a pure IaaS that places little or no restrictions on how its users deploy their computing resources.</p>

<p>We are proud to have been chosen as a 2013 Cool Vendor by Gartner and a Top 25 cloud company in both 2010 and 2012.</p>

<p>The founders of CloudSigma were frustrated with the current market offerings which required users to jump through hoops to migrate their current server setups to the cloud. We fixed that problem by building our own cloud stack that delivers real utility computing in the cloud for the first time.</p></p>

Collectively, we have experience and humility gained by making (and surviving) every stupid decision that could be imagined. We aim to bring fresh ideas to classic web development problems.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on a single web framework, the Pylons Project will develop a collection of related technologies. The first package from the Pylons Project was the Pyramid web framework. Other packages have been added to the collection over time, including higher-level components and applications. We hope to evolve the project into an ecosystem of well-tested, well-documented components which interoperate easily.</p></p>

<p>CodeChix organizes Hacking Sessions, Technical Talks, Technical Workshops and Speaker Series lectures. Some events include Wikipedia’s Operations Infrastructure, Algorithms and Directed Acyclic Graphs, Mobile/Graphic Design for Engineers Workshop, Toy Robotics: My little Pleo, OpenShift Workshop and Android Installfest &amp; App Building 101.</p>

<p>Events are open to all men/women/children or women-only (specified on the event description). Our speakers and workshop teachers can be female or male. Find and join us at <a href="http://codechix.org" rel="nofollow">http://codechix.org</a>.</p></p>
