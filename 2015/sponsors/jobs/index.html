About Us: Textura builds online collaboration and productivity solutions for the commercial construction industry. 

Textura’s solutions serve construction industry professionals across the project lifecycle – from takeoff, 
estimating, design, pre-qualification and bid management to submittals, field management, LEED® 
management and payment.
As a rapidly growing company, we're dedicated to hiring people who share our passion for doing work 
that matters by helping revolutionize such a critical industry. We foster a culture that values creativity, 
intellectual curiosity and personal growth - and we believe that work should be fun! We work hard every

Software Engineer: We’re looking for Software Engineers to join the team and help us continue building innovative solutions to complex business problems. Here is a little info on our team:

We are Pythonistas

We love Python and open source tools like Linux, Apache and PostgreSQL.  We've been using Python 
since 2006 and it's absolutely instrumental to our success.  Of course, while most of our code is Python, 
we endeavor to use the best tool for the job.  We've used Javascript, Java, .NET, PHP, ASP.NET, 
Objective-C and Ruby.  Many members of our team came from backgrounds in C, Java, .NET, or Ruby, so 
if you're not a Python programmer, you can still find a place on the team.

We're a close-knit team

We work closely together in an open team room shared by developers, quality assurance, and business 
analysts.  Team members collaborate throughout the day and work on a variety of tasks.  

We test

We're transferring a significant sum of money each month, so we take testing and quality seriously.  
Between developer unit tests, functional tests, acceptance tests, browser testing, performance testing, 
and exploratory testing, we do our best to ensure that we deliver a product our customers can truly rely 
on.

We build APIs

With a complex and growing application written by a diverse and distributed team using a number of 
technologies, it's extremely important to us to build APIs with reliable and consistent interfaces.
Our teams design and develop multiple robust, secure and scalable applications consisting of multiple 
components using RESTful HTTP, JSON, Python (especially Flask and Django), Celery and RabbitMQ.</div>

- set our own hours, and work from anywhere
- listen to users, and enjoy having our assumptions challenged/tested

You:
----

- enjoy solving complex design and interaction problems
- can explain the decisions behind your work, and the tradeoffs involved
- care more about the user experience than your pixel-perfect concept
- enjoy the push-and-pull of a tight feedback cycle
- work closely with developers to integrate form &amp; function
- understand how HTML and CSS work in the browser
- enjoy exploring outside what you know, and questioning your assumptions
