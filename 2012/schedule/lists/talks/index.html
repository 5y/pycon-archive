                    <p>Music Information Retrieval technology has gotten good enough that you extract musical metadata from your sound files with some degree of accuracy. Find out how to use Python (along with third-party APIs) to determine everything from the key/tempo of a song to the pitch/timbre of individual notes. Then we&#39;ll do some amusing analysis of popular tunes.</p>

                    <p>Cross-compiling is not a use case directly supported by the Python build and extension system. This talk will discuss the process of building python for your embedded platform, and the basics of getting C extensions compiled and running. It will focus on Linux so that the build host and the build target are the same.</p>

                    <p>To really take advantage of Python you must understand how imports work and how to use them effectively.  In this talk we&#39;ll discuss both of these.  After a short introduction to imports, we&#39;ll dive right in and look at how customizing import behavior can make all your wildest dreams come true.</p>

                    <p>Ever wondered how CPython actually works internally?  This talk will show you.  We start with a simple Python program, then slowly step through CPython, showing in exhaustive detail what happens when it runs that program.  Along the way we&#39;ll examine the design and implementation of various major CPython subsystems and see how they fit together.  The audience should be conversant in C and Python.</p>

                    <p>By ensuring consistency and repeatability in setting up the development environments of a team of developers, errors can be avoided (by automating repetitive tasks). It also helps by lowering the entry barrier for new developers, and letting existing developers focus on development tasks without having to worry about infrastructure or process issues.</p>

                    <p>Java is in some ways a bogeyman to the Python community -- the language that parents scare their children with, the Cobol of the 21st century.  But if we look past the cesspool of JEE it turns out that Java has quietly become an excellent systems environment, one that is still in many ways ahead of its time.

In this talk, I&#39;ll discuss why python as a language is well-suited to solving these particular problems, the tradeoffs of different machine learning solutions for python applications, and some tricks you can use to get the most out of whatever package you decide to use.

In this talk we&#39;ll look at how the general concept of interfaces fits into today&#39;s Python.  We&#39;ll also look at some of the alternate proposals of the past, some of the controversies around ABCs, and the direction interfaces might go in the future.</p>

                    <p>PDB is an interactive debugging environment for Python programs. It allows you to pause your program, look at the values of variables, and watch program execution step-by-step, so you can understand what your program is actually doing, as opposed to what you think it&#39;s doing. This talk will show novice and intermediate Python
users how to use PDB to troubleshoot existing code.

                    <p>SQLAlchemy is the object relational mapper and database toolkit for Python, first introduced in 2005. In this talk I&#39;ll describe why SQLAlchemy has always been called a &quot;toolkit&quot;, detailing the software construction mindset for which SQLAlchemy was designed to be used with - what I am currently referring to as the &quot;Hand Coded&quot; approach. </p>

The py.test tool presents a rapid and simple way to write tests.  This talks introduces common testing terms, basic examples and unique pytest features for writing unit- or functional tests: assertions and dependency injection mechanisms.  We also look at other features like distributing test load, new plugins and reasons why some Redhat and Mozilla people choose pytest over other approaches.</p>

A decentralized load balancing-based approach is presented in which each application server keeps track of what it&#39;s good at and presents its resume to load balancers, which use application server resumes to distribute load.</p>

even broader goal was to make it possible to write things in Python that
previous would needed to be written in C or other low-level language.
This talk will show examples of this, and describe how they represent

There are tools and science that can inform your choice of data to present and how best to present it. We reflexively evaluate data and fit it into a narrative which aids decisionmaking; learn how to take advantage of this tendency in order to deliver meaning, not just numbers and charts.</p>

This talk will look at a range of factors which can influence the performance of your Python web application. This includes the impact of using threads vs processes, number of processors, memory available, the GIL and slow HTTP clients.</p>

We&#39;ll also discover what makes some code more testable than others, and how mocks and fakes can help isolate the code to be tested (and why you want to do that). Finally, we&#39;ll touch on some tools to help make writing and running tests easier.</p>

IPython gets you as close as possible to the Python language, with an array of tools for productive work: at the terminal, in GUIs, through a web browser, and in high-level parallel computing.

This talk will explain the design of IPython and provide short, hands-on demos of its main features.</p>

                    <p>The email package in the Python Standard library has had a somewhat rocky transition into the Python3 era, and still doesn&#39;t handle non-ASCII easily.  That is about to change. This talk will compare how things worked in Python2 (the past), how things work now (in Python3.2), and how things will work much better in the future (hopefully Python3.3).

This will also be of interest to others who just want to use of Python in a more power (hungry) way. The core concept is that you can synthesize functions, classes and modules without a direct correspondence to source code. You can also mutate third-party objects and apps.</p>

But do you really know what happens - to your kernel, to your ethernet card, to Python - when you call socket.send()?  Come to this talk and find out: if you dare.</p>

                    <p>pandas is a Python library providing fast, expressive data structures for working with structured or relational data sets. In addition to being used for general purpose data manipulation and data analysis, it has also been designed to enable Python to become a competitive statistical computing platform. In this talk, I will discuss the library&#39;s features and show a variety of topical examples.

                    <p>Django Form processing often takes a back seat to flashier, more visible parts of the framework. But Django forms, fully leveraged, can help developers be more productive and write more cohesive code. This talk will dive deep into the stock Django forms package, as well as discuss a strategy for abstracting validation for forms, and the use of unit and integration tests with forms.</p>

                    <p>Spatial data are often seen as opaque to most developers, and while dealing with them does require a shift in approach from the data types we most regularly handle, they needn’t be the domain of specialists. High-quality Python libraries and Python-based applications exist for operating on and transforming spatial data, and for creating visualizations, including maps for presentation on the web.</p>

However, Java 7 adds the invokedynamic bytecode and corresponding library support, making it possible to finally address these problems in Jython. This talk will describe work in progress to make Jython faster and better (improving Java integration).</p>

                    <p>Is your website accessible? Have you tested it? What does it even mean for a website to be accessible?  In this talk we&#39;ll show some of the most common problems disabled users have and demonstrate how to fix them.  I&#39;ll also introduce you to some tools that are written in Python to help you determine how accessible your site is.</p>

                    <p>Why does “top” show that your Python process uses 110 MB of virtual memory but has a resident set size of 9 MB? Does it consume more memory to spawn several interpreters, or to run one Python and have it fork() further workers? What is an “undefined symbol,” anyway? Learn about how an operating system manages memory, loads shared libraries, and what this means for Python servers and applications.</p>

                    <p>The recent cloud buzz has hugely benefited Python web devs. But, for Python&#39;s formidable scientific community, the cloud has been less ambitious--until now.  PiCloud is a Python-based cloud platform that tackles a noble cause: giving every scientist in the world instant access to a supercomputer. The talk will cover how Python inspired the design of PiCloud, which has now processed over 100M jobs.</p>

                    <p>Understanding the internal state of a running system can be vital to maintaining a high performance, stable system, but conventional approaches such as logging and error handling only expose so much. This talk will touch on how to instrument Python programs in order to observe the state of the system, measure performance, and identify ongoing problems.</p>

A harebrained spare-time project gives birth to a whirlwind journey from basic algorithms to Python libraries and, at last, to a parser for one of the craziest syntaxes out there: the MediaWiki grammar that drives Wikipedia.</p>

It started as an art project, but it has a much more serious practical application: mobile web testing. To trust that your mobile app truly works, you need an end-to-end test on the actual device. BitbeamBot is an Arduino-powered open-source hardware CNC robot that can test any application on any mobile device. </p>

Our secret sauce can be used with your project as well. Reach beyond the test facilities that came with your project, harnessing pluggable test frameworks, dynamically reordering tests for speed, exploring various mocking libraries, and profiling your way to testing nirvana.</p>
