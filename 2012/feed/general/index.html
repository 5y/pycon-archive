            <p>Today the PyCon staff and the Python Software Foundation are happy to officially kick off PyCon 2012, the 10th annual PyCon US conference, happening in Santa Clara, March 7th-15th. We are very proud to launch with a vibrant, refreshed site, updating the overall look and feel and reflecting the energy of the conference and community.</p>
<p>PyCon 2012 is going to pull out all the stops! We want to host the best community conference in the Python community, bar none. Holding the conference in California, so near the biggest technology hub in the United States and with easy access to international travel, means that we expect to break our previous records for attendance.</p>
