                            <p>Heroku (pronounced her-OH-koo) is a cloud application platform – a new way of building and deploying web apps. Developers can focus 100% on  code and never think about servers, instances, or VMs again. Heroku lets you run any application from simple to complex, from Python, Ruby, Java, Node.JS or Clojure</p>

<p>Heroku takes full responsibility for your app&#39;s health, keeping it up and running through thick and thin, while you manage and command your app with a full set of control surface APIs.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of developers have deployed hundreds of thousands of apps to Heroku already.</p>

                            <p>Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring your photos, docs, and videos anywhere, share them easily and keep them safe. Dropbox was founded in 2007 by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, two MIT students tired of emailing files to themselves to work from more than one computer. Guiding their decisions was a relentless focus on crafting a simple and reliable experience across every computer and phone.  </p>

<p>Dropbox has seen amazing growth since it launched in September 2008 and today we have:<br /> - 25M people registered on Dropbox<br /> - More than 1M files saved every 5 min<br /> - 200M files saved daily<br /> - Users in 175 countries<br /> - Dropbox in five languages: English, Spanish, French, German and Japanese</p>

<p>Dropbox is fewer than 70 people total and growing! </p>

<p>This means extremely high leverage for everyone at the company.  We have desktop apps, mobile apps, a modern web presence, and a constantly scaling backend built from scratch. Python is the lingua franca of Dropbox and makes up the vast majority of our codebase. We have lots interesting and challenging work to do and we iterate quickly so it&#39;s not uncommon to see your idea on Monday in millions of peoples&#39; hands on Friday. Meanwhile, you&#39;ll be apart of a small talented team to create something that simplifies peoples&#39; lives.  </p>

                            <p>Twitter is a communication platform that instantly connects people everywhere to what&#39;s most meaningful to them. At the heart of Twitter are small bursts of information called Tweets, which are 140 characters or less in length. However, you don&#39;t have to tweet to use Twitter. Lots of people just use Twitter to get the latest information about the things that mean most to them. With 250 million Tweets per day and more than 100 million active users, there is something for everyone on Twitter, no matter what you&#39;re interested in or where you are in the world. Twitter can be accessed on the web, on smartphones and on the simplest of feature phones.</p>

<p>At Twitter, we believe that the open exchange of information can have a positive global impact and are inspired by stories of people using Twitter to improve the world in unexpected ways.</p>

                            <p>Lex Machina, Inc. began as a joint project between Stanford Law School and the Stanford Computer Science Department seeking to address the dearth of reliable data on IP litigation. Initiated by Professor Mark Lemley, the project sought to shed light on exorbitant jury verdicts, anomalous case filings, and other inconsistencies among federal district courts.</p>

<p>In order to study disparities and other trends in patent litigation, some of the world’s biggest technology companies and law firms funded a team of IP experts and leading computer scientists to map out every electronically available patent litigation event and outcome. The result of this collaboration was the IP Litigation Clearinghouse (IPLC), the most legally rigorous patent litigation database and search engine in the world. The IPLC was launched in December 2008 as a fully searchable web-based “almanac” on U.S. IP litigation.</p>

<p>Through close empirical study and cutting-edge technology, Lex Machina strives to provide historical legal intelligence to the world.</p>

                            <p>Founded in 1998 and led by Cliff Asness, AQR Capital Management, LLC is an investment management firm employing a disciplined multi-asset, global research process. AQR’s diversified offerings range from traditional benchmark-oriented long-only strategies to absolute return alternative strategies. In the alternative space, AQR has continued to develop innovative strategies, including a risk parity strategy (launched in 2006) and a hedge fund risk premium strategy (launched in 2008). We believe our insight from managing alternative strategies directly enhances our ability to attract and retain staff and provide cutting edge thinking to our investment processes, both in traditional and alternative investments.</p>

<p>AQR believes that a systematic and disciplined process is essential to achieving long-term success in investment and risk management. In addition, models must be based on solid economic principles, not simply built to fit the past, and must contain as much common sense as they do statistical firepower. The principals of the firm have been pursuing this research since the late 1980s, and have been implementing this research in one form or another since the early 1990s. The research of AQR&#39;s principals is internationally recognized and has resulted in numerous published papers in a variety of professional journals since 1991.</p>

<p>AQR offers a professional culture that is entrepreneurial and team-oriented where a priority is placed on innovation and creativity. Those with talent and drive are offered a vast array of opportunities to hone their skills and tackle new challenges as they take on ever-greater responsibility.<br /></p>

Our approach is to be open, easily accessible, fast, secure, flexible and extremely inexpensive - our technology is free. We are constantly iterating via weekly releases where we prioritize feedback from our partners as well as market needs. Our infrastructure supports the full spectrum of customers, from independent bloggers to enterprise partners like Major League Baseball. We have done one billion API calls since our launch in 2009 (including over 18 million API calls in a single day). Since day one, the company has been built on Amazon Web Services and we use Django to power our API and Partner Tools. The majority of our internal tools are written in either Python or Bash scripts and all of our integrity, system and load tests are built using Python. </p>

                            <p>Yelp strives to connect people with great local businesses. Python has been Yelp&#39;s primary language since our founding in 2004 and we&#39;re excited to help Python developers connect with each other at PyCon. We use Python for everything from rendering pages on the site to mining our fascinating data using mrjob (check it out at <a href="http://github.com/Yelp" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/Yelp</a>). Yelp had a monthly average of 61 million unique visitors in Q3 2011. By the end of Q3 2011, Yelpers had written more than 22 million rich, local reviews, making Yelp the leading local guide for real word-of-mouth on everything from boutiques and mechanics to restaurants and dentists.

Through our annual fellowship program (<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/" rel="nofollow">http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/</a>), technologists work with governments to leverage the power of the Internet to do more with less, and in doing so, they become civic leaders able to realize transformational change in government with technology. More than just building apps, they’re changing the way government works to be more participatory, connected, and lean.

                            <p>The Pylons Project is composed of a disparate group of project leaders with experience going back to the very start of Python web frameworks. Collectively, we have experience and humility gained by making (and surviving) every stupid decision that could be imagined. We aim to bring fresh ideas to classic web development problems.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on a single web framework, the Pylons Project will develop a collection of related technologies. The first package from the Pylons Project was the Pyramid web framework. Other packages have been added to the collection over time, including higher-level components and applications. We hope to evolve the project into an ecosystem of well-tested, well-documented components which interoperate easily.</p>

                            <p>IPython is an open source project that provides tools for interactive and parallel computing. It is best known for its enhanced Python shell whose features streamline interactive work: tab completion, integrated help, GUI toolkit support, system shell access, numbered prompts, command history and others.</p>

<p>A powerful new architecture for remote code execution has opened the door for a number of new IPython components. A Qt based console provides an IPython shell with inline figures, graphical calltips and persistent sessions. A high-performance, low-latency parallel computing framework provides abstractions for parallelizing Python code on multicore CPUs, clusters, supercomputers and the cloud. A web based notebook provides a user interface and open document format that mixes code with rich text, figures, mathematical equations and arbitrary HTML. Today,</p>

<p>IPython is included in all Linux distributions, and in the Enthought and Python(x,y) Distributions. It is part of Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Tools for Python and the PyCharm IDE, and is a component of a multitude of scientific computing projects in many disciplines, from mathematical environments to hardware control in large experimental facilities.</p>

<p>Free, open source software loses tons of prospective contributors because it is difficult to learn how and where you can fit in.</p>

<p>OpenHatch is an open source community that helps newcomers find their way into free software projects and helps projects become more accessible to newcomers. We work towards this goal through <a href="http://OpenHatch.org" rel="nofollow">OpenHatch.org</a> and outreach events, both online and in-person.</p>
