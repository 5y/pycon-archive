<p>If you've been following Dropbox for a while, you know that we've always tried to keep it simple - in reality, the stuff under the hood is pretty complicated. Over the past couple years, we've had a handful of brilliant minds craft the thousands of moving parts that make up Dropbox, while keeping it easy enough for your grandma to use. 45 million people around the world now rely on us to save  their files every day.
Here are a few of the technical challenges we've tackled:
-Scaled MySQL to handle metadata for hundreds of billions of files.
-Created cross-platform custom Python memory allocators to keep our client memory footprint low when dealing   with lots of files.
-Built a custom LAN protocol allowing Dropbox clients to communicate and transfer files between themselves when on the same local network.
-Reverse engineered operating systems to add icon overlays and contextual menus.
-Designed custom servers that handle millions of concurrent connections.
Dropbox's programming challenges of efficiency and scalability mean there's still a huge range of projects to choose from, and our development cycles will let you see your idea from Monday in millions of peoples' hands on Friday. Meanwhile, you'll be working with talented, like-minded teammates to bring the complex parts of Dropbox together into something that simplifies peoples' lives.</p>

So you will do well if you have experience designing and building large, complex software systems.</p>

<li><strong>Location</strong>: Evanston, IL</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Software Engineer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Leapfrog Online is looking for a talented Chicago-area Python engineer to work in our Evanston office. Our Python engineers build and maintain high-traffic web sites using the Django web framework. We offer a great working atmosphere, a strong focus on work-life balance, and tremendous opportunities to learn new skills and technologies. We also have competitive salaries and benefits and close-knit teams who like what they do. If you're a bright, self-motivated engineer who enjoys using open source software to solve interesting problems, you’re our kind of programmer, and we’d like to talk to you.</p>
<p>As we principally focus on the web, we look for real-world experience using Python application frameworks (such as Django) to build high-traffic web sites and applications. Experience with other languages is welcome. We expect our programmers to have non-trivial experience with any SQL-based RDBMS (PostgreSQL experience is especially useful) in the form of writing efficient queries and executing them via programming language interfaces.</p>
<p>We expect you to have a thorough understanding of common web application concepts and technologies, such as HTTP, SSL, XML and associated technologies, content management concepts, public-key cryptography, application and data security and privacy issues, and basic TCP/IP networking. And, while we don’t expect any graphic design skills from our programmers, you should be comfortable in the world of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>We practice Scrum in all of our development teams, but we don't require previous experience in Agile methodologies. We're also into many pragmatic engineering practices like iterative releases, test-driven development, object-oriented design, refactoring, DRY design, the YAGNI ethic, continuous integration, pair programming and doing regular code reviews. We pride ourselves on building the right culture for producing testable, high-quality code.</p>
<p><strong>What are the extras we look for?</strong> Experience producing and consuming web services (SOAP, REST, XML-RPC); experience working with message-oriented systems (AMQP or other message, pub-sub and task queues such as Celery); deep knowledge of version control systems (especially Mercurial or Git); an interest in non-RDBMS data stores (CouchDB, MongoDB, Redis); knowing what it really means to develop RESTful applications; and, experience with functional and declarative programming models in addition to object-oriented development.</p>
<p>If this sounds interesting to you, you should know we prefer you have a bachelor’s degree and 2 or more years’ experience relating to web-based software development using open source technologies. You should be able to present your ideas and demonstrate your work to technical and non-technical audiences in writing and in person. We will also want to see a code sample upon request; if you do not have existing code samples we will provide you with a few ideas for creating one.</p>

                                <p>OpenShift is an open source, auto-scaling platform-as-a-service for Java, Ruby, PHP, Perl and Python applications. Developers can use OpenShift to host the applications which will power their next great idea and project. From single developers to large teams, it scales mobile and web applications so the development teams can focus on moving forward and doing things better and faster, rather than just trying to make it work.</p>
<p>OpenShift feels more like a start-up in that the team has responsibility for an exciting and rapidly evolving product and business line, but with the support and resources of an established open source software company, Red Hat. The ability to try new things and make something completely new, but with a stable backing is what makes this project and these offerings so fun and exciting.</p>

<p>Imaginary Landscape is a fast-growing Web applications firm in Chicago. We are always looking to talk with experienced Python/Django Programmers who may be interested in joining our development team in constructing intuitive websites and applications to support a variety of business clients.</p>
<h1>We love Python</h1>
<p>We have been a Python based shop for more than a decade, and have been a sponsor for the last 5 PyCons. We are currently using Django as our primary framework. All programming work is done in Python frameworks, with all new work being done in the Django framework. Some work involves supporting existing Paste applications.</p>
<h1>Python/Django Programmers Wanted!</h1>
<p>We are always looking for Python programmers to build Web applications using the Django framework, as well as write Python scripts and maintain existing Paste applications. Requirements include experience with SQL (Postgres preferred), knowledge of the command line in a Linux (or other Unix-like) OS, familiarity with web server technologies (Nginx, Apache, DNS, etc.), and familiarity with one or more web frameworks, such as Django, Paste/Pylons, or Turbogears (Django experience highly preferred).  Familiarity with CSS, JS, unit testing, and a desire to assist in defining application functionality and design are a big plus.</p>
<h1>Contact Info</h1>
<p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:jobs@imagescape.com">jobs@imagescape.com</a>. We'd love to see some interesting code samples, anything from a completed Django application on GitHub to short but sweet Sys Admin Python scripts you've written to help with tedious tasks.</p>

                                <p><strong> Who We Are </strong></p>
<p>Stratasan is a Nashville-based startup in the healthcare sector that provides reporting tools that derive market intelligence from both public and private healthcare data. For example, we provide reports that show past and future market utilization (e.g., how many patients are expected to have heart problems in zip code 11105?), charges and costs, quality measures, etc.</p>
<p><strong> Why You Should Talk To Us </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are a startup in the early stages of growth, so your skills and input will have an impact on the company itself (for good or for evil).</li>
<li>All of our products are on the open-source stack (Python/Django/Postgres/PostGIS), rare in healthcare.</li>
<li>We do some really neat things with GIS (mapping), if you're into that.</li>
<li>We concentrate on data (warehousing, analyzing, summarizing, etc), a burgeoning field.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Who We Need </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An enthusiastic developer with prior experience in at least one common web framework (e.g., Rails, Django, CakePHP). Previous experience with Python is obviously preferred, but if you have dabbled in multiple languages and you are willing to learn a new one, we should talk.</li>
<li>Willingness to write automated tests to prove that your code works. We're not evangelical about TDD, but we are very interested in making our lives a little easier with testing. If you've used Rspec, cucumber, unittest, or PHPUnit, or even Selenium for full-stack testing, then you should be a good fit.</li>
<li>Some knowledge of SQL (we use PostgreSQL with PostGIS) and document storage systems (we use CouchDB). We would love to find someone that has experience analyzing larger data sets (100GB+).</li>
<li>Familiarity with DVCS (we use git).</li>
<li>Strong communication skills are a must. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Where we are </strong>:
Nashville, TN</p>
<p>If this sounds like a good fit, email us at jobs@stratasan.com. Send us a plain-text resume and a way we can contact you. For bonus points, include your GitHub or StackOverflow account.</p>

                                <p><strong>Location:</strong> San Bruno CA</p>
<p><strong>Wanted:</strong> Python engineers that want to keep the world safe as part of Cisco's Internet security team</p>
<p>Serious security threats are being introduced by email and web traffic as more than 1 billion new web pages are added every day and countless messages flow around the world.  Combined with rapid content churn, this content explosion has created a vast "dark web" that challenges traditional gateway defenses.  Cisco's Web and Email Security Appliances address these risks by employing advanced tools including rapid machine learning, acceptable-use policy controls, reputation filtering, malware filtering, data security, and application visibility and control.<br/>
</p>
<p>We have several development and QA positions open for this growing fun team.  This is not an IT position; you will be developing or testing our future web security appliances.  Although network security, routing, and firewall experience are nice, we can teach you those.  What we're looking for are great software engineers with a thorough knowledge of networking protocols and details of TCP/IP.  A general knowledge of HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS, FTP, RTSP, SMTP, IM, and P2P is also preferred.  We are a UNIX shop and most of our development is in Python, with some in Perl, C and C++.</p>
<p>Live in the city without the long commute to Silicon Valley!  San Bruno is a short commute from San Francisco, with shuttles to and from BART and CalTrain.  With our game rooms and relaxed atmosphere, our site feels like a start-up, but with the money and stability of a large company.<br/>

<p><strong>Job Description</strong>: We are a Seattle based tech startup using the “lean startup” methodology to build our company. We are venture backed (Foundry Group / Brad Feld), small, scrappy, and having the time of our lives.<br/>
We are building a platform that helps digital publishers create loyalty programs and game mechanics into their site or application through points, badges, levels, virtual currency and virtual goods. But we don’t just build stinkin badges, we build economies for our partners. We're developing a game mechanics and virtual economy ecosystem based around our RESTful API to interact with our MySQL database for clients and we do high volumes of transactions. Our customers include digital publishers, content providers, app developers, goods vendors, and advertisers. Our platform is extensible in order to allow a wide variety of apps to be built on top of it.<br/>
In other words, we are trying to make the entire online world a lot more fun and engaging. As such, we aren’t a stuffy, stodgy or boring company. We are a small pack of geeks trying to have as much fun as we can while accomplishing an amazing amount of progress toward our goal.<br/>
We find resume’s boring and dry, but we love real tech demo’s. As you can tell, this isn’t a “typical” job, and we aren’t looking for a “typical” person. We are looking for people with a technically creative mentality and we are looking for people who have passions outside of work. Nuff said. On to the goods.<br/>
We need a Python Dev to help us with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play a key role in the design, architecture, implementation and deployment of new products and enhancements to existing products.</li>
<li>Work with the operations team to design effective and optimized deployment architecture/infrastructure</li>
<li>In the event of issues in production systems, assist in the identification and resolution of defects.</li>
<li>Participate in the planning and execution of product releases.</li>
